so here we are testing the script 

- first we have validate the `6HD4` with the homo ligand 
    - so we have the r.pdbqt and the maps.
    - we also know the grid box 
    - first we should copy the all filse from the validation - exept l.pdbqt, r.dlg, r.glg
    - then we should import the r.dpf and r,gpf atom types from this repo [Readme](./README.md/)
then run the readme and have fun :)
